# Therapy_Thoughts

Therapy Thoughts is a ticketing system for clients to interact with their mental health provider(s). Many providers recommend clients keep thought journals and items noted they would like to discuss at future appointments. This app would act similarly however clients can set a priority level on each item and it would connect back with your provider so they can review your list before your appointment and allow for them to prepare if necessary. This can also be used document, recap, provide additional resources if necessary/wanted on what was discussed to be able to refer to later should the client ever need a refresher and/or the topic needs to be continued into further sessions. I'll be focusing on creating a basic IU and Database model as well as looking what could be done to ensure this would meet HIPPA compliance requirements.
